# Blockchain Registry Dapp

Give this app your first and last name and it'll store it on the blockchain. Nothing fancy.

## Special cases

1. You can only store one record per address in the registry
2. Only the record creator or the admin can "delete" a record from the registry.
3. You can view all the records on the blockchain.
